The immediate vicinity of Newington Green is awash with good eateries, Belle Epoque, The Newington Table, the hotly anticipated Perilla due to open at the start of November, Tarangalin for Tapas, The Leconfield & The Lady Mildmay for a great Sunday Roast and several really superb turkish restaurants who cook on the open grill, the one directly opposite the house is a family favourite. We also have several good pubs, the aforementioned Sunday Roast venues are equally good for a glass of wine or a pint, as are The Cellars and The Winnicott. Newington Green is steeped in history, the area became home of English Dissenters during the 17th century including Daniel Defoe. Arguably the most important resident of the Green was the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft who moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to Newington Green.

Thanks,13126536,2014-03-14,"I grew up in East London and after working for a couple of years in the City I went to work in a ski resort in France. I then continued with my travels and spent time in Crete, New York (met my husband), Luxembourg,Tokyo (had my first son), Geneva and then after being away for 10 years I moved back to London and had my second son. I like cooking but my main passion is baking so you may get to sample some homemade cakes. I live with my husband Neill and my boys who are now 14 and 16
I still really enjoy travelling and over the last few years we had some amazing family holidays to Sri Lanka, last year we spent 3 weeks on the coast of Costa de la Luz which was stunning and we have just returned from 3 weeks travelling around NZ which is our new favourite place. I am rather partial to a glass of NZ sauvignon blanc and going to the gym when I have a free moment. I think I am a very hospitable host and am known for making people feel very welcome.
I have already hosted over 90 bookings so far  and I am really enjoying it. I really enjoy being hospitable and I think the effort I put in with welcome drinks, snacks and home made cakes has paid off with the lovely reviews guests have left. I hope to have many more guests. Unfortunately the London Mayor has imposed a limit of 90 nights per year for entire places and mine falls between an entire place and private room so once hosts have to list as private rooms it is harder to find as many good places.

I do enjoy the travelling experience of knowing what's ""out there"". My first travelling experience was travelling from coast to coast in South America, we encompass a great diversity of landscapes and also time zones so not quite easy feat to do.

 I have been to most countries in Europe and some in Asia! I just love meeting new people and knowing more about their culture, life, experiences etc. I feel quite privileged to be a Travel Agent and have this contact with people, being able to direct them to some amazing locations around the globe and also welcome them to London - taking away all the hustle of travelling and providing fantastic experiences. It makes me feel good to see people enjoying themselves and also notice that, in most part, they are grateful for the service.  My motto in life is: "" You always get what you give"".

Don't just take our word for it, here is what Airbnb has to say about the surrounding area. SOHO Like Britain’s famous agent, James Bond, this neighbourhood leads a double life: Soho’s streets are home to clean-cut record shops and fashionable galleries. Crowds flock to this edgy epicentre to experience its sultry past and trendy present. Soho’s red-light roots and beatnik bastions have steadily transformed into hip public houses, all-night coffee shops, and vintage boutiques that welcome the 24-hour clamour of this cobblestoned neighbourhood.  https","INFORMATION REGARDING THE CHECK IN We will request your arrival and departure times which must be provided in advance of your stay so we can make arrangements for your check in.

We are Lee, Laiyan, Tina & Glenn :)

We are a small team of people who have been working together for several years providing accommodation in the heart of central London. We mainly provide accommodation for workers in the film and theatre industry, but with the growing popularity of Airbnb we have been able to offer out our places to people from all over the world. We pride ourselves on providing excellent service and over time we have come to feel like part of a family.

As hosts we prefer to allow guests to have their privacy and enjoy their time staying with us so for the most part we tend to leave them to it, but we have several means of contact if they need anything and the team will do their upmost to help out so that you can get on with the main thing which is having a fabulous time in this great city.

From collective experiences of the team we have a few favourite things to do in London. For theatre goers we have experienced some great musicals such as Wicked and Hamilton, and for those with a brave sense of humour the Book of Mormon is a must watch. We have also sampled some great places to eat such as the award winning Barrafina on Dean Street, and being so close to Chinatown we couldn't help but recommend Beijing Dumpling for some amazing culinary delights.

We hope that you will choose to stay with us here in London and we look forward to sharing our wonderful accommodation in the best location you could possibly be in.

We have lived in and loved London for many years but while our home here is still the mothership  we are living far more of a nomadic life these days.  Since we are out of town so often, we have geared the house much more towards dedicated  guest accomodation. Over the years we have worked hard to make our house a haven from the bustle of London life - a place to step back, relax and replenish. We are really enjoying sharing it with the Airbnb community,  and hope you will enjoy it too.

London is a spectacular city and this is why I decided to call it ""Home"" - To those of you who read this and have been here, you'll know exactly what I mean! It's just great!

I love travellers and that's why I am a travel agent here in London. I am originally from Brazil and have travelled quite a lot around the globe.  I do enjoy the travelling experience of knowing what's ""out there"". My first travelling experience was travelling from coast to coast in South America, we encompass a great diversity of landscapes and also time zones so not quite easy feat to do.

 I have been to most countries in Europe and some in Asia! I just love meeting new people and knowing more about their culture, life, experiences etc. I feel quite privileged to be a Travel Agent and have this contact with people, being able to direct them to some amazing locations around the globe and also welcome them to London - taking away all the hustle of travelling and providing fantastic experiences. It makes me feel good to see people enjoying themselves and also notice that, in most part, they are grateful for the service.  My motto in life is: "" You always get what you give"".

Location. This is pretty central. Twenty-five minutes from the door to Oxford Street, Angel Tube station is 5 minutes away on foot.  2. The main bathroom. It's pretty lush. 3. The service. Enda lives a few minutes away and we both sincerely want to make you feel welcome.  4. The linens and towels. You'll get luxury hotel grade linens and towels. We use a great company called Best4Guest to provide these (as well as fab toiletries and other goodies). 5. Peace of mind. We recently got the Plum Guide diploma for excellence. They checked the place (and me!) out thoroughly and they reckon we're pretty good! Two Less Good Things About Kith & Kine: 1. The second bedroom. While it has a lovely double bed, the second room would be a bit of a squeeze for two people for more than a few days. If four of you wanted to stay for a few days, that's probably fine, but for an extended stay, the room is better just for one person. 2. Street level.

London is a spectacular city and this is why I decided to call it ""Home"" - To those of you who read this and have been here, you'll know exactly what I mean! It's just great!

I love travellers and that's why I am a travel agent here in London. I am originally from Brazil and have travelled quite a lot around the globe.  I do enjoy the travelling experience of knowing what's ""out there"". My first travelling experience was travelling from coast to coast in South America, we encompass a great diversity of landscapes and also time zones so not quite easy feat to do.

 I have been to most countries in Europe and some in Asia! I just love meeting new people and knowing more about their culture, life, experiences etc. I feel quite privileged to be a Travel Agent and have this contact with people, being able to direct them to some amazing locations around the globe and also welcome them to London - taking away all the hustle of travelling and providing fantastic experiences. It makes me feel good to see people enjoying themselves and also notice that, in most part, they are grateful for the service.  My motto in life is: "" You always get what you give"".

Art & Culture A tireless innovator of art and culture, London is a city of ideas and the imagination. Londoners have always been fiercely independent thinkers (and critics), but until not so long ago people were inherently suspicious of anything they considered avant-garde. That’s all in the past now, and the city’s creative milieu is streaked with left-field attitude, from theatrical innovation to contemporary art, pioneering music, writing and design. Food in all its permutations has become almost an obsession in certain circles. Time Travel London is immersed in history, with more than its share of mind-blowing antiquity and historic splendour.

I’m also a big fan of National Geographic! Aside from being educational or informative, it’s fun to read and watch documentaries with brilliant photos and videos. It’s more fun to learn when you’re entertained as well. They are just amazing.

We are a small team of people who have been working together for several years providing accommodation in the heart of central London. We mainly provide accommodation for workers in the film and theatre industry, but with the growing popularity of Airbnb we have been able to offer out our places to people from all over the world. We pride ourselves on providing excellent service and over time we have come to feel like part of a family.

As hosts we prefer to allow guests to have their privacy and enjoy their time staying with us so for the most part we tend to leave them to it, but we have several means of contact if they need anything and the team will do their upmost to help out so that you can get on with the main thing which is having a fabulous time in this great city.

From collective experiences of the team we have a few favourite things to do in London. For theatre goers we have experienced some great musicals such as Wicked and Hamilton, and for those with a brave sense of humour the Book of Mormon is a must watch. We have also sampled some great places to eat such as the award winning Barrafina on Dean Street, and being so close to Chinatown we couldn't help but recommend Beijing Dumpling for some amazing culinary delights.

It's a walking distance to the trendy East and a tube ride away from the shopping and sights in the West End. A tube stop is in proximity, and buses and NIGHT TUBE are running 24/7. Nearby, explore craft breweries or order a curry from plentiful Indian takeaways. I'm also happy to help with your itinerary by sharing local tips. My bed is very comfortable to sleep on, and I have two different pillows (one medium and one hard) – you'll get a great sleep, guaranteed! The roof window is the source of all good: natural skylight during the day, natural darkness at night, and the sound of raindrops on a grey day. Also, it won't be noisy even if you leave a window open for some fresh air. Whether you're coming for work or leisure, you won't regret staying here! The bathroom features a shower and a toilet.

The road is in the heart of the East End. It's a friendly, funky place to shop for some real bargains. The market takes place on Tuesdays and Thursdays but it's busiest on Saturdays.  Bouillabaisse and other fancy dishes at Palmers Restaurant. Given that most of its nearby competitors are chicken shops, this family-run place is surely the road’s best-kept secret. You’re in east London, so go traditional and pick up pickled herrings and rollmops at George’s Plaice, a bona fide purveyor of all things brined and aquatic that’s been going strong for more than 40 years.  There’s nowhere better for proper East End food than G Kelly. Nothing to do with the ‘Singin’ in the Rain’ star, but we can assure you that the bargain pie and mash here is stellar.","Just to reiterate that this is my room where I live when I don't travel, so there will be my stuff in the cabinet and the drawers. Please respect my privacy and that of my housemate. If you are unsure about anything at all, write me a message, and I'll get back to you quickly. If you're staying several days, don't hesitate to ask for a discount.","Getting around is extremely easy. Tube runs every few minutes (walk to the Mile End station in 15 min or take a 5-8 min bus to Bethnal Green or Mile End). There are night buses, so it's easy to get back even late at night. Now, also NIGHT TUBE is available (search for TfL Night Tube for more info), it runs every 10 minutes throughout the whole night and takes only 15 minutes from Soho/Holborn!!! If you fancy an Uber ride, it won't break your budget either, as the location is easily accessible for driving.","The bathroom features a shower and a toilet. The kitchen is large, and it has all amenities: fridge, microwave, stove, kettle. There is also a shared back yard where you could go for a smoke or park a car. For a picnic, it's better to go to a beautiful park nearby.","Throughout your stay I'll be away, but available online. My housemate can help you sort any issues that might arise. I'm happy to help you with your itinerary in advance of your stay – I can give you tips on best places to see, secret bars to drink in, easiest hacks to the city.","- It's a residential house, so you have to be mindful of my housemate. - Additional guests/visitors are not permitted at any time. - You can smoke in the outer yard. - Please leave it as you'd like to find it.",75929392,2016-06-05,"I'm 27 and I work in climate finance (it's a nonprofit that rates investors on managing financial risks of climate change).

The room was lovely with a beautiful skylight and I loved the little details of having fresh flowers in the room, fresh towels, menus and recommendations of things to do in the area all laid out. My flight landed a bit early and Martin and Petra so graciously accommodated us to check in a bit early which helped immensely since we didn't have to be carrying our bags around London. Fresh (delicious) coffee with biscuits were also provided to us in the morning. Alot of great conversations were had also. Thank you Martin and Petra for such a great experience for my first time in London and making our stay so enjoyable and comfortable. I highly recommend staying here.""

""I had a wonderful stay at Martin and Petra's place, they are an absolutely lovely couple and I felt very relaxed there. Their place is perfect for a comfortable rest, the extra little touches exceeded my expectations. The room is exactly as pictured and the level of cleanliness was one of the highest I have experienced with Airbnb. Extremely comfortable and clean bed, I would definately want to stay again. Thanks Martin and Petra for making me feel so welcome :)""

""A fantastic find, excellent value and literally a 30 second walk to Northfields Station with a direct train into the city in 25 minutes!! Lovely clean room, with nice touches including toiletries! Martin and Petra were attentive and welcoming hosts throughout. Quiet location with parking sorted for by Martin! Thank you both!""

""Martin and Petra are truly wonderful. They helped me with my bags and in the morning they made me a delicious coffee! They also recommended a wonderful Indian restaurant near them and made sure that I was comfortable and had everything I needed. Their place is very close to the tube station and 30 minutes to the airport door to door. This was super convenient for heading to the airport the next day!""

""Not to mention this place is super close to the tube station which takes you to airport and central London, Martin and Petra are great hosts that made me feel home during my stay. They provided everything needed for the trip, also gave great recommendations on the restaurant and travel spots. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay and oh don't forget to try St. Maria pizza near the apartment:)""

""Very nice hosts and more than willing to help you out wth recommendations on places to eat nearby and make you feel at home. Nice and convenient location near the Northfields underground station that can take you directly to Heathrow in 20 mins on the Piccadilly line. Bed was comfy and the room and bathroom were nice and clean.""

""My boyfriend and I needed to stay in London for one night before moving on to Gatwick the following day, and Martin & Petra's apartment was perfect! Not only is it an easy four minute walk from the nearest tube station, you'll also find a cozy and comfortable room waiting for you when you arrive, which is great after a long day of traveling. Even though our stay was short, I think any solo traveler or couple will find Martin & Petra's flat perfect for their London stay. Thanks for everything! Hoping to be back soon.""

""Martin and Petra were great hosts. The room was clean, organized, and provided all toiletries possibly needed. It was very close to the tube station and easy to get to and from Heathrow airport. Would definitely recommend to all guests looking for a lovely, warm, and comfortable room.""

""Everything was excellent. Thank you for the wonderful time.""

""Martin & Petra were two wonderfully friendly and warm people. We arrived feeling exhausted and overwhelmed from our flight and they made us feel so welcome and rejuvinated. We would absolutely love to stay again. Absolutely great!""

""Martin & Petra were absolutely the best. Very friendly and loads of fun to talk with. So much so that we spoke until 5:30am in the morning! They didn't seem like typical hosts but more like friends. The space is just what we needed for our 17hr hour layover from Iceland back to New York. They also gave us some great recommendations on where to go and places to eat around London. They even gave us really insightful life tips :). It was the perfect end to our awesome trip! By far the best hosts we ever had. You won't be disappointed.""

""Martin and Petra were awesome hosts and the place was great! Close to the train station to get into central London. Private comfy room and shared bathroom. They have an adorable rabbit named Abbie. We had some great conversations and and they were a lot of fun to sit and chat with. They also suggested so many great places to eat locally, especially an Indian restaurant named Papaya within walking distance to their place. We enjoyed getting to know them and would recommend this place to any traveler wanting to get to know London.""

""Martin and Petra are a lovely couple and very easy going. The room is clean and comfortable and sharing the flat with the two of them (and their cute rabbit) is entirely uncomplicated. They are well prepared to have some extra toothbrushes at hand because some forgetful guest, like myself, would pack everything except her toothbrush! (still, you should bring your own toothbrush ;)) The apartment is located within half a minute walking distance away from the tube station of Piccadilly line. It is very convenient especially if you are flying in from Heathrow. Piccadilly line runs along major attractions of London and I could do all my planned sightseeing over the weekend without changing lines.""

""There is so much to say, but I have to leave some for you to find out! Martin and Petra were amazing to stay with, such gracious hosts and such a great room to stay in. Location is amazing, its literally around the corner from The Tube but you don't hear it, awesome shops within walking distance, and its on the Picadilly line which services Heathrow, straight into downtown London and to the St Pancras station for that quick jaunt to France! If you want an amazing place to stay, great hosts, and easy access to a lot to do, Martin & Petra are the best to stay with. We cannot plan our next trip back to the UK soon enough, and definitely going to stay here again!""

""Martin and Petra are very friendly people. My girlfriend and I very much enjoyed talking with them. I was visiting from the US and I had several questions before my trip. I got responses from them so quickly--thank you so much. The room and bathroom were very clean. It was a fantastic stay with them and I would definitely go back when I visit London again. Thank you Martin and Petra.""

""Petra and Martin are two lovely people whose home has been our home for seven days. As hosts, they are everything you could desire, and beyond. Always helpful, full of good advices, always smiling and at your service. The acomodation itself is really great. As written, it's one minute of walk from the tube station, in a safe and quiet neighbourhood. The bedroom is clean, rather spacious and warm. There are a couple of packages of coffee and a tea selection waiting for You on the table, with cups and everything necessary to make you feel even more ""at home"" and cozy. The privacy is guaranteed, as well as a warm ""hello, how was your day?"", ""good morning, do you need anything?"" or a simple ""would you like some tea?"" :o) Petra offered us to use the kitchen if needed, in every single way, as well as some bathroom necessities in case we have forgotten our own (such as toothpaste, shower gel or even a makeup remover, which comes handy!) The flat in general is very clean, comfortable, warm and cozy, which is no surprise since there are two welcoming, kind and lovely people living there. Would come back anytime! :o)""

""Martin and Petra were amazing. When I landed in London the airlines misplaced my luggage. When I got to Martin and Petra's place I told them what happened. They were so kind in offering me anything I needed. The place was sooooo easy to find. One simple train ride from the airport about 20 min. The directions given were easy to follow. Martin stayed in constant communication with me leading up to my arrival. The room was very clean and exactly as pictured. They made me feel at home. They were very helpful in offering suggestions on places to visit. I was there only a night, so Martin helped me book a tour bus of London. They also invited me to lunch at a yummy Thai restaurant. I can't forget adorable Abby, their pet rabbit. She was even welcoming. I could go on and on. I will definitely be back in my next visit. Thank you again Martin and Petra for your wonderful hospitality.""

""Super clean, cozy and kind stay. Both of the hosts are incredibly friendly and supportive, the place is in a really good spot of London, easy to reach and to navigate around. Thank you, guys, for an amazing stay.""

""I would recommend this to anyone who wants to stay in the West London area. Martin and Petra are very nice and from the last time I stayed they even had improvements such as available keys both for the room and the house and an easy wi fi password. It was a pleasure to know I would be comfortable after a long working day! Great place!""

""Martín and Petra where great hosts with a great flat, ideally located for early flights from Heathrow. Martin and Petra where even kind enough to drop me off at their amazing local pizzeria. #win""

""Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. I had the best nights sleep and found the room comfortable, quiet, clean and cosy. It was lovely to meet and chat to you both and I think you have a lovely home. Thanks for making me feel so welcome.""

""Absolutely the nicest, most interesting hosts you could possibly stay with. Martin and Petra's place gets a lot of bookings and deservedly so as their flat is a warm, happy, friendly and comfortable environment and atmosphere.""

""As a 21yr old this was my first time flying/traveling solo, the love and hospitality Martin and Petra showed me not only warmed my heart but made my stay 1000x better. Whilst my home is 25 hours away in Australia, I felt right at home, like I was apart of their family, which is a special quality not to be taken lightly. I 100% recommend Martin and Petra's room to anyone in need of a home away from home.
