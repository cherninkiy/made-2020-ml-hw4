1112797,26933941,overall trip was great location to transportation was great great pub down the street with awesome fish and chips very quiet area i mean no disrespect to the host and consumers/travelers need to know what expect when dealing with this particular host after traveling for 15 hours and arriving at a location which was provided in the emails no one was present on our arrival and it started to rain we waited for almost an hour at this location hoping she would arrive and let us in as we did not know what else to do or expect we had no wifi to contact our host to gain entry because she was not there to greet us we asked a passing local who was kind enough to text our host and she did not reply to the text as we saw this person approximately 20 minutes later coming back in the opposite direction we initially saw her going we had to walk with all of our heavy and cumbersome luggage in the rain to a pub down the street who was kind enough to let us use their phone to call our host she then gave us the correct address which was in the opposite direction of which the initial address location was provided and did not have an answer as to why the address in all communications was incorrect she told us she had been waiting for two hours for us at the flat which makes no sense as we did communicate with her at the airport upon arrival as the airport had wifi for us to do so she then gave us a combination to a lockbox that was incorrect to obtain the key she told us there were two combinations to this particular lock box and as a realtor for 10 years in the unites states and dealing with this same brand of lock box i knew this was inaccurate so back to the pub in the rain to call her again and she gives us a different combination which did work her accent is very heavy and difficult to understand her the gutter leaks above the front door at the entryway which makes it slippery so be careful watch out for possible mail on the floor when you enter overall the flat is small and pleasant and there are a few things to be aware of not enough towels only one towel per person provide by the host no hand towels no wash cloths no paper towels or napkins no fan for those random hot days hair dryer has no plug adapter so bring your own and it can only be used in the kitchen since there is no outlet in the bathroom in the bathroom the shower is a nerve racking experience due to the water flowing out into the rest of the bathroom a squeegee is provided and honestly who wants to have to constantly be concerned about the water flowing into the rest of

939250,20301087,disappointed the pics look good and the location is ok but in reality its not great after a long journey we wanted comfort but the place was bare and cold plus the entrance at the front was dirty and very steep i requested a cot for our baby and he asked me to go halfers with another future tenant 30 pounds each which i thought was strange i mean do i keep half of it or am i buying things for your property for your customers travel cots are 27 pounds at argos so we got one ourselves and hey we got to keep it the place had no hand soap no kitchen towels the kettle was old and full of limescale we had to buy one to use the bath towels had some stains and there was fake tan on the walls the pics make it look good but theres a lot of touches that have been botched or done on the cheap painted over damp walls cheap thin curtains wires not concealed properly etc my dad leaned on a wall and he got wet from damp and had white paint on his shirt which was all peeling off not ideal there was wet cloths under the sink which were likely used for the toilet the mop bucket had water in it and the hoover was left out in the front bedroom the kitchen was missing pans and utensils etc very basic and very bare overall also on check out we were told two different times 1100 and 1200 we went by a manual sent to us which stated 12 and at 11 we had the cleaner outside ushering us out with a baby and 3 people this is just not good the street is a main road to a 24h a&e hospital we counted 4 loud ambulances scream past on the first night so moved the baby to the back room the tubes are 15 minute walk although it is very close to the olympia overground station which might be handy if coming from gatwick and a 20 min walk to earls court which has a direct tube to heathrow tubes aren t that close really positives are the heating works well and the showers are warm although the central shower did leak from above the shower head if the price was in line with other property s of this standard in the area that would be fine but paying a premium for a non premium property left a sour taste

905700,19598017,we are an american family of 4 two preteens and this was our first trip to london and first airbnb experience to use an american term we feel like we hit a home run with robert and this apartment/flat the great 1 robert - very responsive before and during the trip met us personally to check in and give us various tips about the location things to do etc very thoughtful in terms of including things in the apartment such as milk butter eggs an amazing loaf of bread cookies crackers -all of which we devoured was extremely flexible in terms of check in and check out times for us his super host title is well deserved 2 location of the flat - a 3 minute walk to a tube stop kensington high as well as high st which has everything you could possibly need for a stay things mentioned in previous reviews like whole foods mark and spencer s grocery boots pharmacy etc can walk to kensington palace and gardens with the tube all of the tourist destinations in central london are within 15-20 min away the good 1 the flat was very quiet 2 the flat space was perfect - beds were comfortable note there are two bedrooms one with a good double bed and one with two twin size mattresses - one on the floor and one a true bed - our kids had no issues with them 3 the flat had all the necessary appliances microwave fridge/freezer electric range/oven dishwasher and washing machine the flat did not have a clothes dryer we air dried our clothes 4 the flat felt secure the bad nothing major if you are looking for an architecturally sophisticated exterior of the flat or its street this is probably not the flat for you it sits on a tiny cobblestones street in a two story row of flats the views from the windows are of surrounding flats and we often kept the shades down for privacy as doing otherwise could allow a neighbor to see us and vice versa if you are looking for picturesque views this flat is not for you other reviewers have already mentioned the narrow staircase which is only about 10 steps and might be difficult for those with very large suitcases all this being said the neighborhood is one of the most expensive in london if not the entire country and it is incredibly diverse in terms of architecture the street and flat are cozy and quaint to me this flat is perfect for 2-4 people looking to be in a safe secure quiet area with easy access to all things london we were delighted to find this after another airbnb host cancelled on us with 11 days before the trip - tip always book a backup hotel with free cancellation when using airbnb we really enjoyed our stay and cannot recommend robert enough

851722,18301449,good location for south london small size but ok for a short stay
967342,21043525,there are two sides of experience with this apartment and host positive it all looked easy simple and basic the host looked friendly as he was present at check in-although it is self-check in he also let me leave luggage for few more hours until 15 00 which i appreciated it is an apartment shared with other young people and it was pleasant to have the opportunity to chat with them and exchange stories about our countries the kitchen has all needed although it did not have oatmeal as mentioned and not sufficient amount of coffee anyway i did not want to complain about it as it was minor i also respected the owner increased heating after i asked the apartment is old with old furniture and windows bed pressure in water pipes discolored walls and ceiling but generally clean i did not mind some issues with slightly disjointed chairs and bed all would be ok however there was unfortunately an issue with the bed after i left the host sent me a photo of a crack on one side of the bed i was very surprised because i saw the bed had some issues of having disjointed parts i remember the bed having a crack but it looked like a quick fix and therefore i did not mind i suggested to the host to fix it with several solutions from buying and fixing a sideboard few pounds in any do-it-yourself store he can fix it with l-joints to asking neighbours to help who are repairing their home at the exact time and have all the tools or getting a bed for free at websites where people give away furniture for free the bed was very old anyway and fixing was needed unfortunately i started to think that it was host s plan all along in order to claim damage from an innocent victim-guest in order to get a new bed i am suspecting this since he dismissed all my suggestions and did not want to talk to me anymore while i was trying to suggest solutions the host waited for the last day of the review 14th day after my stay deadline for reviews and claims to claim 100 pounds ignoring my earlier messages since the issue of bed is still not resolved i do not know what the host will tell in his review on my stay asking that much money for a simple sideboard is too much i was hoping he will be sincere and honest and respect all the options i have suggested to him to resolve this situation i am not running away from paying if i damaged something but i simply do not want to be accused of something i did not do i only have good experiences with airbnb so far positive reviews and i have always respected all homes i have been in and all hosts respected me there were always high level of appreciation between me and my hosts

721293,15402561,the check-in process was by far the worst experience i ve had to deal with through airbnb - we were told that we could get check-in at 2pm we arrived at the check-in place already at 2 05pm as we had arrived at london early in the morning and wanted to drop the suitcases finally to a safe place the guy at the shop kept saying he doesn t work there and we should come back in 10-15 minutes also kept changing the time the code irma gave me was invalid and the phone number i was given by her did not answer and went to voicemail every single time so i was so damn scared that the whole thing was a scam finally when we received the keys after the shop owner came back saying that he has had a lot of trouble with this company we were so scared that the apartment would not be as promised however we were happy to see that the apartment was fine the beds were awful the sofa had been fixed with some duct tape but otherwise the apartment was as promised and concerning the location served us well for a couple of days in london

650145,13841484,the booking and pre-visit process was very straight forward no issues with communication kostas gave us everything and was very helpful i believe the concierge is the man that is supposed to meet you at the place if you miss him aka arrive after 5pm then you are left with security i had agreed for parking beforehand however an issue arose after we arrived the security guard had no key to get into his office where the keys were we had to wait an hour for someone else to bring the keys once he got into the office he refused to give the keys it took a lot of calls back and forth but it did all get sorted in the end wasn t the best start however after that point the flat was spot on no issues perhaps bigger than the pictures and defiantly one of the bigger ones on the block came with pretty much everything we needed great tv warm rooms two bathrooms pretty much everything you would find in a hotel great little kitchen etc and no issues getting in or out either the area is defiantly very mixed a whole range of people live in the area there wasn t any anti-social behaviour however it is a very busy area and you could tell it was the kind of place that could get quite dangerous in the day however it is fine there are lots of families etc when we came back late a night however the atmosphere is a little different no trouble etc but defiantly different

742182,15900139,pm is a host that repects your privacy but does respond rather timely to requests and issues the apartment is good value for the price and located in a very convenient spot not everyone will think highly of elephant and castle but we think it is quite lively and actually safe enough the apartment can be easily improved with better blinds and curtains and nicer pillows too the kitchen hob was not working during our stay and we also think kitchen utensils should be replaced to make cooking easy without problems overall we think it was fair value given london s expensive rental everywhere but apartment can be easily improved with limited expenses
656995,14003878,our stay was superb and we were sad to leave the attentiveness of zula was spot-on from the get-go and even though my reservations were made months in advance zula was very accessible and attentive to questions etc in the time leading up to the trip the welcome we received by her father richard when we arrived was far above and beyond anything we would have ever expected not only did he provide each of us four adults with our own key he arranged for one of us who was coming at a different time to get the key from him separately which i thought was very accommodating of him also he actually had fresh fruit all kinds of milk and juices snacks and a gorgeous bouquet of fresh flowers waiting for us which we never would have expected honestly the flat itself aside the generosity of this host was second to none the flat was extremely quiet inside even though the street was bustling during the day we arrived on a saturday which was a busy tourist day on the street but we stayed all week long and noticed tourist vibe was gone as soon as the weekend was over - this flat was absolutely beautiful and very atmospheric with lots of creative artsy touches like a curved door entry into the bathroom skylights lovely eclectic decorating super cozy bedding cool roof-top view from the kitchen window etc one of the many features i so appreciated is that is seemed like everything had been thought of there was literally a reading light in every spot where one would need one and a hook for every towel and coat etc etc there were lots of cozy nooks to sit with one of richards many interesting travel books and the patio garden was enchanting early in the morning note the door to enter the flat is literally in the doorway of a shop entrance zula told me this in advance which made the place easy to find could have been tricky to find the door had i not known to look in a shop doorway also when leaving the flat in the later hours of the day it s a good idea to leave the entryway light on for yourself so you can see your way through the inner hallway to the flat upon your return -

738799,15826198,sam s place is in a great location easy access to the lambeth underground station within 3 to 4 minutes walking distance there are two other rooms available to be rented so be aware you are sharing one bathroom although honestly it was never an issue for us as most people were really only there to sleep and then went about their day in wonderful london sam went above and beyond helping us out when we were in a pinch and he was really fast with the responses in regards to previous reviews regarding the rooms i will say the room was a little bit stuffy but we also had record temperatures during our stay and i didn t mind opening the window to try and let in a cool breeze every now and then the bed isn t the most comfortable in the world but after a long day roaming the streets of london you ll be exhausted enough that you sleep no problem plus if you re really looking for the comfort of a serta sleeper mattress then shell out the big bucks for a hotel i would stay again thank you sam for the great stay

1007436,21978157,overall we had a nice experience at shimmy s place unfortunately the flat was very hot during our stay due to a plumbing problem but this should be fixed quickly so no worries the self check-in is very nice as it provides great flexibility and the room is clean and nicely decorated the flat is located in a quiet but not very beautiful part of london a bit far from the main touristic places - but it is quite cheap so the value is there one last thing while we didn t get to see shimmy or kinny they were very thorough in their explanation and very fast to answer the questions we had a big plus all in all we recommend this room

862614,18564665,great house in terms of size space and location unfortunately it wasn t to our requirements as a family with 2 small children and a baby 3 of the bedrooms didn t have curtains there wasn t adequate kitchen things bowls plates etc we knew there would be air beds but one was broken and not sufficient bedding for them these are simple things you expect on a weekend away 2 of the bedrooms literally were just a room with an air bed no curtains no bed no bedside table no lamp nothing the other 2 bedrooms had beds 1 had a blind the other just had a bed kitchen looked ok not adequate things for us to make our own breakfast or lunch we are talking basic cereal sandwich not enough plates no sharp knifes no chopping boards simple basic things we use every day also no cleaning stuff cloths anything very disappointed and it made the weekend slightly more stressful then it should ve been we spent over 1000 for 3 nights and feel like with wasn t justified the house was falsely advertised - no curtains or blinds in 3 bedrooms - no bedding for single air bed - single air bed broken - advert does say roof terrace/balcony this is a death trap for children open - not adequate kitchen stuff - no shampoo or shower gel as advert we had to buy additional bedding and blankets and pillows we made blinds as best we could for kids and baby what was most stressful is we had communicated with the host asking if it was suitable for the children we requested adequate seating and essentials for 8 people but nothing materialised but if a room is advertised as a bedroom you expect curtains this is not worth the money or staying
